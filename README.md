These project includes all competitions and homeworks which I participated in college.
In the ML_presention, predicted stock market price with AR, LSTM and random forest model and evaluate which model is better in prediction of time series data.
In the report of Matlab competition, used fast-RCNN and CNN model to predict 100 kinds of goods by more than 6000 pictures.
